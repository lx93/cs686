grepis a UNIX utility that is used to search for patterns in text files. 
It’s a powerful and versatile tool, and inthis project you will implement a version that,
 while simplified, should still be useful.1Your project is to complete the implementation ofrgrep,

 output if and only if the pattern “matches” the line.
 For example, we can usergreptosearch for lines that contain text file names that are at least 3 characters long (plus the extension) in a file like thefollowing:
